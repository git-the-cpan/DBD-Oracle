===============================================================================
General Outstanding Issues

Return codes and error handling not quite same as oraperl?

Many others. Remember, this is still alpha software!

Support shared libraries with Oracle 7.3

Add a mechanism for fork style tasks so dbh of parent
doesn't get freed by child.


===============================================================================
Below is just a personal dumping ground for thoughts and issues, don't
expect any structure:

(or even anything at all)

Check -R etc for libsunmath.so.1
ldd /cmi/run/lib/perl5/site_perl/sun4-solaris/auto/DBD/Oracle/Oracle.so
	libclntsh.so.1.0 =>	 /home/oracle/home/lib/libclntsh.so.1.0
	libsunmath.so.1 =>	 (not found)
