[ Tim Bunce, 16th Nov 1995: The only change I've made to these
  original oraperl examples by Kevin Stock is to add the magic
	eval 'use Oraperl; 1' || die $@ if $] >= 5;
  line to each. ]

This directory contains a few sample Oraperl scripts. Some are genuinely
useful (sql, for example, is installed as part of make install) while
others are just demonstrations of different things.

bind.pl		Demonstrates how &ora_bind() and &ora_fetch() may be
		combined to make a simple table lookup program

commit.pl	Demonstrates the use of &ora_commit() and &ora_rollback()

ex.pl		This was my first ever Oraperl script. I think I wrote it even
		before writing Oraperl! It reads data from a table and prints
		it using a format. It also illustrates how to recognise NULL
		fields.

japh		Just another Perl hacker, written in Oraperl
		This is no one-liner, but it demonstrates a few things.

mkdb.pl		Creates a database, puts some data into it, drops it. The nice
		thing about this is that it detects whether it is running under
		Oraperl or Coraperl, and changes its output accordingly. It
		also illustrates handling of NULL fields, with both &ora_bind()
		and &ora_fetch().

oradump.pl	Dumps the contents of an Oracle table into a set of insert
		statements.

sql		This was written in response to a posting on the net, asking
		whether there was a tool which would execute an SQL statement
		specified on the command line. Manual page built-in.

tabinfo.pl	Displays the structure of the specified table.
		This is mainly to show the use of &ora_lengths, &ora_titles
		and &ora_types.
